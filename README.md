# Local Library Late Returns Data Analysis

This project analyzes late returns at a local library to uncover patterns and causes. The goal is to help the library reduce late returns by identifying key factors such as:

- **Demographic trends**: Examining patrons' education, occupation, and age.
- **Library branches**: Identifying high-risk locations.
- **Book characteristics**: Investigating book categories, prices, and lengths.
- **Seasonality**: Analyzing trends in late returns by time of year.

The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and recommendations for operational improvements.
